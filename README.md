# Friend Share - Item Sharing Platform

A .NET web application that enables users to share items with their friends circles. Built to run in Docker, this platform allows users to list personal items they're willing to lend, create friend groups, and manage borrowing requests within their trusted network.

## Project Overview

Friend Share is a social sharing platform where:
- **Users** can create accounts and authenticate securely
- **Item Owners** can list items they're willing to share with friends
- **Friend Circles** allow users to create groups of trusted friends
- **Borrowers** can discover available items from their connections
- **Requests** can be made to borrow items, with owner approval workflow

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 8 / ASP.NET Core
- **Frontend**: ASP.NET Core MVC or Blazor
- **Database**: SQL Server or PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture
